    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>French toast is a western staple breakfast and brunch item. It tastes amazing and is highly versatile and customizable with toppings and fillings. Unfortunately for us, most of the time, french toast is often filled with added fats and sugars, and drenched in absurd amounts of high calorie toppings and syrup. Not many people would consider it a very viable breakfast for most, unless you're a behemoth of an athlete who just needs the calories. Much like most junk food, hyper-palatability is the main culprit. Food that is high in calories and tastes exceptionally good is extremely easy to overeat. Not to say you should never eat it, but only that it should be in moderation.</p>
      <p>Luckily for you dear reader, who is probably a lover of french toast since you clicked this recipe, I have a really tempting proposition for you. What if you could have french toast as a staple breakfast and eat it everyday without the downsides that I discussed previously? If that interests you any bit, feel free to keep on reading. Yes! I am hereby presenting to you, a "healthy" french toast recipe. Healthy is in quotation marks because that word is highly context dependent. Healthy for an athlete might not be healthy for the typical stay at home mom or the office job middle aged father. However, if you follow this recipe to it's very core, you will be sure to recieve a very calorie friendly option for a french toast recipe. The quantity of slices and the toppings can then make it less "healthy" depending on your own personal needs and goals.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Liquid Egg Whites</li>
        <li>Bread (white or brown both work)</li>
        <li>Your choice of low calorie or calorie free sweetener (I prefer stevia's taste)</li>
        <li>Pan Spray Oil</li>
        <li>Any toppings or fillings you want (optional, will add extra calories!)</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Get a non-stick pan and spray for a second or few to cover it</li>
        <li>As the pan warms up, pour egg whites into a deep plate or wide bowl</li>
        <li>Dip your bread slices completely into the egg whites, then flip and repeat</li>
        <li>By now, your pan should be hot, so you should carefully transfer the slices one by one, making sure they don't break</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to medium-low and let it cook for a few minutes before flipping so it get's cooked through completely</li>
        <li>Flip when it's golden brown, and repeat on the other side</li>
        <li>After taking them off the pan onto a plate, you can layer them with nutella and peanut butter like I do, or you can get some sugar free syrup and keep the calories lower</li>
        <li>Enjoy! Every day, multiple times even!</li>
      </ol>
