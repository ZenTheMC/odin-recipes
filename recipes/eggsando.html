    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Egg Sando stands for Egg Salad Sandwich, or Egg Sandwich. It has been a very popular worldwide dish for a long time, and each place makes it with their own style. It is especially very popular in East Asian countries. The name Egg Sando however, is Japanese specific. In Japanese, one of the common ways of saying sandwich is Sand or Sando or Sandoichi. Regardless, these delights are extremely popular particularly in Japan. There are many variations to them even within Japan, and many popular convenience stores make their own types with unique twists. Some have chicken teriyaki, some have fried chicken or pork cutlets, some have tuna salad, and some have boiled whole eggs added in, like in the picture above. It is a very common and sought after convenience store food, and Japan loves their convenience stores. You wouldn't think it, but convenience stores in Japan are very common, with multiple different types around every corner. These sandwiches are often getting sold out because they are a common breakfast and lunch product. In fact, when I visited Japan, they were part of my breakfast every morning from the local 7-11 convenience store. Today, I hope to share some of that joy and my love for Japan, this food item, and the culture behind it. Hope you enjoy!</p>
