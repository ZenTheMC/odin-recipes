    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Gyudon is a Japanese cuisine staple. It has long been a part of the culture since Japan is known worldwide for their amazing beef. Just like Wagyu or Kobe, two very popular cuts of beef, Gyudon uses fatty beef as well. Instead of big chunky and marbled steak cuts, like the former, the latter is thinly sliced fatty beef sauteed with two types of onions, and served on a bed of rice, finished with a garnish of scallions, and a side of pickled red radish and a sunnyside egg. Now, I know your mouth is already watering, but before you get up to grab a snack or order in from your local Japanese spot, keep on reading.</p>
      <p>This dish is a perfect mix of carbs, fats, and protein. A very well balanced meal with a meat/protein, rice and vegetables, and some egg yolk and beef fat. Nutritionally, it is really decent, and is quite filling to top it off, since it is mostly whole food with little to no extra added calories. Typically, there is a sweet and umami sauce that is put in this, but not nearly enough for you to get overwhelmed by it. This has been a staple food choice for me since my trip to Japan 2 years ago, and I hope you dear reader net as much joy from making and eating it as I do.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Thinly Sliced Fatty Japanese Beef</li>
        <li>Japanese White Rice</li>
        <li>One Extra Large Egg</li>
        <li>Pickled Red Radish</li>
        <li>Scallions/Green Onions/Spring Onions</li>
        <li>White Onions</li>
        <li>Your preferred brand of Gyudon Sauce</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Spray or oil your pan if you want, but it's not needed since the beef is fatty</li>
        <li>Throw your beef on a pan on medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Throw in thinly slices or chopped white onions. You can do this before or after the beef depending on if you want them more cooked or crunchy</li>
        <li>Keep the heat and stir-fry with a splash of the Gyudon sauce you bought</li>
        <li>Add your green onions when the beef and white onions are almost done, which will not take long since we're using thin cuts</li>
        <li>While your meat and onions are cooking, add your cooked rice to a bowl or deep plate</li>
        <li>Transfer contents from pan into your bowl or plate and garnish by sprinkling raw spring onions on the top</li>
        <li>Add in more of your sauce, straight into the bowl, so the rice and toppings can really soak all the juice in and become flavorful</li>
        <li>While the pan is still hot, crack open your egg and throw it into the pan. You can oil or spray if you want, but there should be plenty of leftover grease from the meat</li>
        <li>Cook the egg carefully without overdoing it and cooking the yoke. We need the runny yoke</li>
        <li>Transfer your egg to the bowl and decorate your plate with the pickled radish and more scallions. You can add other sides too, to customize it to your personal desire without losing the core of the dish</li>
        <li>ENJOY! No, seriously you must... enjoy it... or else :)</li>
      </ol>
